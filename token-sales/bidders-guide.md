## Bidder's Guide

Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCAs) provide a fair, transparent way to participate in token sales. This guide explains how to bid, what to expect, and how to claim your tokens.

### What is a CCA?

A Continuous Clearing Auction is a fully on-chain token sale mechanism that discovers fair market prices through transparent bidding.

**Key features:**

* Your bid automatically splits across remaining auction blocks, proportional to supply
* Clearing prices rise as the auction progresses
* Everyone in a block pays the same clearing price
* All bids and prices are visible on-chain

**Why CCAs are fair:**

* No timing games or sniping
* Early participation is rewarded with lower prices
* Large orders can't dominate individual blocks
* Front-running is unprofitable

### How to Participate

#### Step 1: Connect and Verify

Navigate to the project's sale page and connect your wallet.

#### Step 2: Review Auction Details

Check the critical parameters:

* **Auction duration:** How long the auction runs (e.g., 7 days)
* **Floor price:** Minimum price set by the project
* **Bid currency:** USDC, USDT, or ETH

#### Step 3: Place Your Bid

Enter two values:

* **Total budget:** The total amount you want to spend (e.g., $10,000 USDC)
* **Max price:** The highest price per token you're willing to pay (e.g., $1.00)

Your bid automatically splits across all remaining auction blocks, proportional to how tokens are distributed in each block.

> **Example:**
>
> * Total budget: $10,000
> * Max price: $1.00 per token
> * Remaining blocks: 20
> * Your bid = $500 per block (10,000 ÷ 20)
>   * If clearing price ≤ $1.00 → Your bid succeeds (you're "in range")
>   * If clearing price > $1.00 → Your bid fails (you're "out of range")

Complete required KYC verification.

#### Step 4: Monitor the Auction

Watch as blocks clear in real-time. The Tally interface shows:

* Which blocks your bid succeed in
* The clearing price for each block
* Your current token allocation
* How much of your budget remains in future blocks

#### Step 5: Wait for Auction to End

Once the auction ends, the Tally interface will guide you through claiming your tokens and any refunds.

### Understanding "In Range" vs "Out of Range"

This is the most important concept for how CCAs work.

**Your bid is "in range" when:**

* Your max price is at or above the current clearing price
* Your bid is actively competing for tokens in each block
* Your funds are locked in the auction contract

**Your bid is "out of range" when:**

* Your max price falls below the clearing price
* Your bid becomes invalid for all remaining blocks
* This happens automatically when the clearing price exceeds your max

#### Why this matters

All bids start "in range." You can only submit a bid if your max price is above the current clearing price. Once your bid is submitted, it remains in the auction until:

1. You get outbid (clearing price rises above your max price), OR
2. The auction ends

\{% hint style="info" %\} Clearing prices rise over time in CCAs. If you set a limit order, your bid will start "in range" (early blocks with lower prices) and may eventually go "out of range" (later blocks with higher prices). This design prevents gaming and ensures all participants are making credible commitments. \{% endhint %\}

**Key insight:** While your bid is "in range," your funds are committed to the auction. You can't withdraw until the auction ends or you go "out of range" (get outbid). This prevents last-minute manipulation and ensures everyone's bids are real commitments.

### How Tally Simplifies the Experience

Uniswap's CCA smart contracts are powerful but technically complex. Tally's interface abstracts this complexity.

**What Tally handles automatically:**

* Exit calculations and determining the correct exit function
* Tracking which blocks you participated in and your outcomes
* Refund calculations from unsuccessful blocks
* Clearing price calculations

**What you see:**

* Live clearing price
* Clear progress through the auction
* Real-time allocation updates
* Exit auction button and "Claim Allocation" button when the auction ends

**What happens behind the scenes:**

* Complex exit logic for partially filled bids
* Checkpoint hint calculations
* Pro-rata share computations
* Multi-step claim processes

You get a smooth, intuitive experience while the full security and transparency of Uniswap's on-chain auction runs underneath.

### Bidding Strategies

#### Understanding Bidding Modes

Tally's CCA interface offers two ways to bid: Advanced and Simple (Market Orders). Understanding both helps you choose the right strategy.

#### Advanced

**What it is:** You specify both your total budget AND the maximum price you're willing to pay.

**How it works:**

* Total budget: $10,000
* Max price: $1.00 per token
* For each block:
  * If clearing price ≤ $1.00 → Your bid succeeds
  * If clearing price > $1.00 → Your bid fails

**Best for:**

* You have a clear valuation for the token
* You want price protection over guaranteed allocation
* You'd rather get fewer tokens at good prices than many tokens at any price

#### Simple (Market Orders)

**What it is:** You specify only your total budget. The interface automatically sets your max price very high to essentially guarantee participation in all blocks.

**How it works:**

* Total budget: $10,000
* Max price: Auto-set to $10.00 (or higher)

You participate in all blocks and pay the actual clearing price (not the high maximum).

\{% hint style="info" %\} You don't actually pay the high maximum. You pay the market-determined clearing price for each block. The high maximum just ensures your bid succeeds. \{% endhint %\}

**Best for:**

* You want to participate and trust the market to find fair prices
* Allocation certainty matters more than price control
* You're buying for long-term utility, not short-term trading
* You don't want to guess at the "right" maximum price
* You're bidding at low volume

**Example:** You place a market order for $10,000 when 20 blocks remain. Your bid automatically splits: $500 per block ($10,000 ÷ 20)

* Block 1 clears at $0.85 → You spend $500, get \~588 tokens
* Block 2 clears at $0.92 → You spend $500, get \~543 tokens
* Block 3 clears at $1.05 → You spend $500, get \~476 tokens
* ...
* Block 20 clears at $1.30 → You spend $500, get \~385 tokens

Total: $10,000 spent across all blocks. All blocks succeed because your auto-set max ($10.00) is well above clearing prices. Your final allocation depends on the actual clearing prices across all 20 blocks.

***

### Placing Multiple Bids

You can place multiple separate bids during the auction.

**When you might place another bid:**

* Your first bid has gone "out of range" (clearing price exceeded your max)
* You want to add more capital to the auction
* You want to bid at a different max price

**How multiple bids work:**

Each bid you place is independent and splits across all remaining blocks. If you place multiple bids, they stack in each block.

**Important to understand:**

* Each bid tracks independently whether it's in range or out of range
* Multiple bids from the same address combine in each block
* You can't modify an existing bid. You can only place additional new bids
* Each new bid splits across all remaining blocks from when you place it

#### What You Can and Cannot Do

**✅ You CAN:**

* Place additional new bids at any time during the auction
* Place multiple bids with different max prices
* Monitor clearing prices and your allocations in real-time

**❌ You CANNOT:**

* Cancel or withdraw a bid that is "in range" (actively participating)
* Modify an existing bid's max price or amount
* Claim tokens before the auction ends

***

### Understanding Partial Fills

Your bid will likely not succeed in every block, and that's completely normal.

**Why some blocks fail:**

* The clearing price exceeded your maximum price
* Your bid was "out of range" for those blocks

\{% hint style="info" %\} The CCA mechanism is designed so that clearing prices rise as the auction progresses. Early blocks typically have lower clearing prices. Later blocks typically have higher clearing prices. If you set a max price, you're more likely to succeed in early blocks and fail in later blocks. \{% endhint %\}

**Example scenario:**

* You bid $10,000 across 20 blocks at $1.00 max price
* Block clearing prices (rising over time):
  * Blocks 1-8: $0.70-$0.95 → 8 successful blocks (in range)
  * Blocks 9-12: $1.05-$1.15 → 4 failed blocks (out of range, above your max)
  * Blocks 13-20: $1.18-$1.30 → 8 failed blocks (out of range, prices continued rising)
* Result:
  * 8 successful blocks out of 20 (mostly early blocks)
  * Spent: 8 × $500 = $4,000
  * Refunded: 12 × $500 = $6,000

**Key takeaway:** Partial fills are a feature of price discovery. With limit orders, you typically succeed in early blocks (lower prices) and may fail in later blocks (higher prices). This is by design. You get exposure at the prices you're comfortable with.

### How Prices Are Determined

#### Clearing Price

Each block's clearing price is where supply meets demand for that specific block.

**How it works:**

1. The auction collects all bids for a block
2. Bids are ordered from highest max price to lowest
3. Starting from the top, bids are filled until the block's token supply is exhausted
4. The clearing price is set where supply runs out

Everyone whose max price is at or above the clearing price succeeds and pays the clearing price.

#### Why prices rise over time

The CCA mechanism is designed so clearing prices increase as the auction progresses. This happens because:

* Bids are spread across all remaining blocks
* As blocks clear, there are fewer remaining blocks for the same bid amounts
* This concentrates demand in later blocks, pushing prices up
* Early bidders benefit from lower prices (incentivizing early participation)

**Example:**

* Block supply: 1,000 tokens
* Bids for this block:
  * Bidder A: $600 budget, $1.20 max
  * Bidder B: $800 budget, $1.00 max
  * Bidder C: $400 budget, $0.95 max
  * Bidder D: $500 budget, $0.90 max
* Result:
  * Clearing price: $1.00
  * A pays $1.00/token (not $1.20), gets 600 tokens
  * B pays $1.00/token, gets 400 tokens (partial fill)
  * C and D fail (max prices below $1.00)

**Key insights:**

* You never pay more than the clearing price, even if your max was higher
* Everyone who succeeds pays the same clearing price
* Bidders right at the clearing price may get partial fills
* Clearing prices typically rise over time (early blocks = lower prices)

#### Your Token Allocation

**Per block:**

```
Tokens received = (Your bid amount) ÷ (Clearing price)
```

**Example:**

* Your bid per block: $500
* Clearing price: $0.85
* Tokens received = $500 ÷ $0.85 = 588.24 tokens

**Total allocation:** Sum the tokens from all successful blocks.

### When the Auction Ends

#### Claiming Your Allocation

1. Wait for the auction to end. The auction must complete all blocks.
2. The Tally interface shows your final allocation:
   * Total tokens you received
   * Average price you paid
   * Total amount spent
   * Refunds from unsuccessful blocks
3. Click **Claim Allocation.**
   * Tally handles the complex exit logic automatically
   * Your tokens transfer to your wallet (or to a vesting contract if applicable)
   * Any refunds for unsuccessful blocks are included
   * You're done.

***

### Key Concepts

#### Uniform Pricing

Everyone who successfully bids in a block pays the same clearing price.

* If you bid $1.50 max and the block clears at $0.90, you pay $0.90
* This incentivizes you to bid your true valuation

#### Bid Splitting

Your bid automatically divides evenly across all remaining blocks when you place it.

* Prevents large orders from dominating single blocks
* Enables continuous price discovery
* Each portion uses your maximum price
